## 🧠 Description

The NEURO-CYCLE Module is a self-sustaining micro-factory designed to recycle Martian and mission-generated waste into useful materials for construction and manufacturing. Its goal is to create a closed-loop system that transforms carbon residues, human waste, EVA remains, plastics, and regolith into “cosmic cement” and 3D printing filament essential for sustainable living on Mars.

## 💡 Stages of development
The module is built as a circular structure divided into six stations (“slices”), each equipped with dual-function machinery:

1. Collection & Pre-Shredding – A sealed hopper and primary jaw crusher receive regolith (for cement) or plastic waste (for filament).

2. Fine Grinding & Separation – A dual micronizing mill pulverizes regolith with carbon and mineral additives or plastics with aluminum powder.

3. Integrated Thermal Reactor – Activates regolith for geopolymer cement or melts plastic pellets for filament extrusion.

4. Synthesis & Dosage – A bioreactor produces biopolymers (PHA/PLA) or activates alkaline solutions for cement.

5. High-Shear Mixing – Homogenizes cement paste or molten plastic mixtures.

6. Extrusion & Curing – Outputs either filament spools or 3D-printed cement structures in a controlled chamber.

An AI-driven classification system, using a camera and microcontroller, identifies incoming waste and automatically adjusts each capsule’s configuration, switching between cement or filament modes. The system is supported by a real-time monitoring platform, enabling astronauts to visualize and manage temperature, pressure, and material flow through every stage.

## 🧪 Experimental Solution

- The NEURO-CYCLE integrates a closed thermal loop, capturing and redistributing waste heat from the thermal reactor to maintain bioreactor temperature (30–40°C) and accelerate cement curing.
- Water released during curing or biomass drying is also recovered and reused, minimizing resource loss.
- To minimize mass during transport from Earth to Mars, the module’s structure would be built from lightweight alloys and composite panels (such as aluminum-lithium and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer). Once on Mars, local regolith and mission waste serve as primary feedstock, reducing resupply needs.

## 💸 Estimated Savings
- Based on waste projections from extended Mars missions, the NEURO-CYCLE could process and repurpose up to 65–75% of total mission waste, significantly lowering environmental impact while providing essential construction materials.
- By merging automation, AI, circular economy principles, and in-situ resource utilization, the NEURO-CYCLE transforms waste management into a productive cycle supporting long-term human presence on Mars while redefining sustainability in space exploration.
